# Tips:
- Make AUT testable, then only start work. 
- In Fact if it requires you to pull code in your own system and to do changes by yourself, if the developer has no time for the same.
- Donâ€™t wait for the developer to make AUT as testable. Remember this is for you, so it can be done by you also.
